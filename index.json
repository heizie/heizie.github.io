[{"content":"Abstract Vision-based robotic grasp detection is an important fundamental element in the bin-picking tasks. However, the existing methods of vision-based robotic grasp detection are not sufficient to handle the flexible geometries of deformable linear objects, such as cables. Therefore a new solution for detecting cables in an application scene is proposed, which consists of a Swin Transformer with deformable convolutional layers as the backbone network, the feature pyramid network as neck, and Hybrid Task Cascade as RoI head. For the test-time augmentation, closing and average operations are utilized to improve the performance of the segmentation phase. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method obtains 21.5% AP and 4.7% segm AP gains compared to state-of-the-art Mask R-CNN or CenterMask. Based on the proposed 2D method, the detected 2D segmentation masks could provide a strong possibility for choosing data points in 3D space, which is a key element for the bin-picking task.\nImportance in short    Things I\u0026rsquo;ve done  Developed anchor relevant modules for 4-dimensional RoI Transformer from scratch Building assumption models according to the failure cases and developed improvements connect to the scenario Designed and managed dataset; Fast implementation and failure analysis with multiple state-of-the-arts as the baseline Pytorch based Detectron 2 and MMDetection are used  ","permalink":"https://heizie.github.io/posts/masterthesis/","summary":"Abstract Vision-based robotic grasp detection is an important fundamental element in the bin-picking tasks.
