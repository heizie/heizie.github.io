[{"content":"Abstract For detecting deformable linear objects (DLO), such as cables, CNN based methods are insufficient for industrial use, such as for bin picking task. In this paper, based on various baseline model from state of the art (s.o.t.a), the difficulties of detecting cables are found, and depends on those, we\u0026rsquo;ve developed a combination of a 2 stage vision Transformer with HTC framework (Fig. 1) to reach the best performance of detecting cable with s.o.t.a.\nWithout bells and whistles, the proposed method obtains 21.5% AP and 4.7% segm AP gains compared to s.o.t.a methods.\n        Fig. 1 The Struture of out proposed method    What, How, Results What  Based on founded technical difficulties of cable detection, a visual Transformer based method is developed. Our method for cable detection achieve 79.9% box and 33.4% segmentation AP.  How  Based on the classes' scales of the target, local spikes on the feature maps are observed. Based on the classes' quantity, special loss function for imbalance dataset is used for testing the assumption (whether the \u0026ldquo;imbalance\u0026rdquo; affect the accuracy) Comparisons between the Swin Transformer and ResNet are used for proving the negative effect from crossing side to side object. Implemented anchor-based or anchor free Region Proposal Network (RPN), observed whether the regression distance affect the accuracy. Implemented oriented proposal based (i.a. rotatable box) RPN, observed whether the one-to-one relation between box and segmentation affect the accuracy.
